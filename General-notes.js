UI EXPERIENCE
1. If the photo doesn't present for some reason, and doesn't load properly, the text below the photo is go up.
2. If there is a lot of images I will consider to take a part or create a pagination.
3. When you open a photo on the modal I think the best practice is to add the photoId to the params above, so when you refresh the page you will see the same photo.
4. I didn't like the style of the close button, it looks like a character from the text.
5. There isn't any part of post to upload a new photo.
6. It cursor-pointer on the card is working only when clicking on the photo, but not working if you click on the text, if the place isn't clickable, you should remove the cursor-pointer.
7. When editing a photo, the chance happens, but the photo goes to the end of the list, so I need to search where is the photo that I edited. it was a little bit better to use shift instead of push or splice.
8. Don't know why but sometimes the photo on the catalog is shown but when clicking on it the modal that presents the photo is broken.
9. The choose file is without any style, just the built in input type file, I don't like it... I prefer to use a button on the main page.
